I will be building a one time password authentication using React Native.

### Tech Stack
* **React Native:** show user a form to sign-up and sign-in.
* **Twillo:** send text messages to users.
* **Firebase:** store user data, including user accounts and correct one-time password codes.
* **Google Cloud Function:** tiny bits of code that run one time on demand. Has access to data in Firebase.
